# Quora Question Pairs
A Kaggle competition to identify whether a pair of questions are similar. This repo contains my notebook which contains code I wrote while exploring how to solve the Kaggle challenge. Although its a little messy, it was meant for me to learn how to use machine learning libraries. 


## Requirements
  + [Keras](https://keras.io/)
  + [Tensorflow]()
  + [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  + [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  + [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/)
  + [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  

## Model 

The model used by me is the Siamese LSTM. I got the idea from this [paper] `Jonas Mueller and Aditya Thyagarajan. 2016. Siamese recurrent architectures for learning sentence similarity. In Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI'16). AAAI Press 2786-2792.`
